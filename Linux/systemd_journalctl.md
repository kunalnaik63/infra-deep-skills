# üñ• systemd vs init, and journalctl

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview ‚Äì init vs systemd
### init (SysVinit)
- The traditional service manager for Linux systems.
- Executes startup scripts located in `/etc/init.d/` sequentially.
- Simpler, but slower boot times due to lack of parallelization.

### systemd
- Modern replacement for init, adopted by most major Linux distributions.
- Starts services **in parallel**, reducing boot time.
- Uses the concept of **units**:
  - `.service` ‚Äì individual services
  - `.target` ‚Äì groups of services, like runlevels
  - `.mount` ‚Äì filesystem mounts
- Handles dependency management between services.
- Integrates with **journald** for centralized logging.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Common systemctl Commands
`systemctl` is the control interface for systemd.

```bash
# View status of a service
systemctl status <service>

# Start/Stop/Restart a service
systemctl start <service>
systemctl stop <service>
systemctl restart <service>

# Enable/Disable at boot
systemctl enable <service>
systemctl disable <service>

# List all running services
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```


# Journalctl 
### Logs for a specific service
journalctl -u <service>

### Logs since a certain time
journalctl --since "2024-08-11 10:00:00"
journalctl --since "2 hours ago"

### Only errors
journalctl -p err

### Logs from the previous boot
journalctl -b -1

### Live (follow) logs
journalctl -f
